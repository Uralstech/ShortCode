# ShortCode
A small python library for lazy devs. This shortens the amount of code you have to write for your program with the help of functions.

Scripts in library:

SCUI: Helps you with the in-built tkinter ui.

SCFileSystem: Helps you with opening, reading and writing files.

SCSort: Just a bubble sort algorithm that I added in for fun :)

Find more info about each script using the (script name).help() function.
